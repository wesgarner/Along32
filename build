# This is a script instead of a Makefile for demonstration purposes.
# You will have needed to install the Along32 library before this, of course.

# Assemble the .asm, being sure to specify 32 bit mode.
nasm -f elf32 -o hello.o HelloWorld.asm

# Link the .o with the library, also being sure to specify 32 bit mode.
ld -lAlong32 -m elf_i386 --dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2 -o hello hello.o

# There should now be a "hello" executable.
